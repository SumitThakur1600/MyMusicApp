            <strong>Music theory</strong> is the foundation of all music‚Äîit
            helps us understand how melodies, harmonies, and rhythms come
            together. Whether you're composing, playing an instrument, or simply
            listening, understanding the basics of music theory enhances your
            experience.

            <strong>üéº Scales & Keys:</strong> Every song is built on a scale.
            The <strong>major scale</strong> produces bright and happy tones,
            while the <strong>minor scale</strong> often carries emotional or
            moody characteristics. Learning different scales helps musicians
            create melodies and harmonies that fit together seamlessly.
          </p>

          <p className="text-neutral-400 text-lg text-center leading-relaxed mb-4">
            <strong>üé∏ Chords & Progressions:</strong> Chords are groups of
            notes played together, forming harmony. Common progressions like{" "}
            <strong>I-IV-V-I (C-F-G-C)</strong> serve as the foundation of
            countless songs. Mastering chord relationships enables musicians to
            improvise, compose, and enhance musical expression.
          </p>

          <p className="text-neutral-400 text-lg text-center leading-relaxed mb-4">
            <strong>ü•Å Rhythm & Time Signatures:</strong> Rhythm gives music its
            movement and flow. A <strong>4/4 time signature</strong> (common in
            pop and rock) provides a steady beat, while a{" "}
            <strong>3/4 waltz</strong> introduces a graceful, dance-like rhythm.
            Understanding rhythm helps musicians stay in sync and develop strong
            timing.
          </p>

          <p className="text-neutral-400 text-lg text-center leading-relaxed mb-4">
            <strong>üé∂ Melody & Harmony:</strong> Melody is the{" "}
            <strong>soul of a song</strong>, the part you hum or sing. Harmony
            adds richness by combining multiple notes. A deep understanding of
            melody and harmony allows musicians to craft memorable compositions
            and intricate arrangements.

          <p className="text-neutral-400 text-lg text-center leading-relaxed mb-4">
            <strong>üëÇ Ear Training & Notation:</strong> Great musicians can{" "}
            <strong>hear a note and recognize it instantly</strong>. Ear
            training and musical notation literacy empower artists to play by
            ear, transcribe melodies, and communicate music effectively.
